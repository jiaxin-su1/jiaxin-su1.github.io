## Work Experience
**Lab Manager @ Bionic Vision Lab, UCSB (_September 2024 - June 2025_)**
- Organized personally identifiable information (PII) data in human subject experiments in Google Sheets and assisted with 
recruiting and scheduling participants for virtual reality (VR) experiments.
- Conduct and manage VR experiments with over 20 participants to examine how minimap, compass, and direction arrow help people
  navigate under stressful conditions.
- Interviewed and onboarded new research assistants, ensuring compliance with human subject training and safety protocols and
  furthered human subject data collection instructions to ensure comprehensive experiment data collection.
  
**Undergraduate Learning Assistant @ UCSB PSTAT Department (_September 2024 - December 2024_)**
- Held office hours for 9 hours every week, guiding students in solving homework questions and enhancing students' understanding
  of course material.
- Planned and guided 10 undergraduate students in developing their future course schedules to align with their academic
  interests and career goals.
- Initiated multiple students’ in-group discussions on course materials during office hours.

## Projects

**Course Recommendation Engine using BM25 and NLP**
- Developed a course recommendation engine using NLP preprocessing techniques and BM25 similarity to match UCSB 
course descriptions with student interest, major, and other student profiles, enabling personalized top-5 course suggestions.
- Automated course data collection from the UCSB Academic Curriculum API and built NLP pipelines in Pandas using 
rank_bm25 to compute BM25 similarity scores.
- Empowered students to find interest-aligned courses 3× faster via personalized similarity search and saved department 
advisors dozens of hours each term by automating repetitive recommendations.

**SPROUT: Plant Disease Detection & Care Assistant**
-  Designed and developed SPROUT, a responsive plant health web platform supporting image uploads, plant disease 
diagnosis, user authentication, and chatbot interaction, capable of identifying 38 plant diseases across multiple crops.
- Built a backend database using SQLite and Flask-Login to manage user account id, uploaded plant pictures, and plant 
diagnostic history with access control, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- Achieved 2nd place out of 20+ teams by optimizing diagnostic processes to provide rapid disease predictions and care 
guidance within 10 seconds, improving real-time usability.

**Predicting the temporal dynamics of prosthetic vision**
- Coauthored a conference paper titled “Predicting the temporal dynamics of prosthetic vision,” published a peer-reviewed 
conference paper in IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE EMBC).
- Extracted data points from a previously published paper by other research groups with WebPlotDigitizer and ensured data 
integrity using Google Colab with NumPy and Matplotlib library.
- Developed a step-wise temporal model with exponential and sine decay functions (r = 0.7 across all data) to predict artificial 
vision fading and persistence under varying stimulus conditions, linking electrical stimulation directly to perception.

**Using Machine Learning to Predict Dementia**
- Incorporated risk gene APOE_e4, personal life habits, cognitive performance, and seventeen other factors into dementia 
diagnostic machine learning models using R package Tidymodels.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using ggplot2 to identify variable relationships and built multivariate ML models 
(KNN, decision tree, elastic net, logistic regression) to predict dementia status for 1,000 participants.
- Produced a mean AUC of 0.96 through 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrating strong predictive performance for dementia 
classification models integrating genetic and lifestyle factors.
